# whistle_3Dprint
Make fancy whistles using a 3D printer.

Most of the files are half of the whistle for easy 3D printing.

---
## V1_normal

Just a whistle. It generates sound at 2.8 kHz.

### V1.1_doubleSize

Frequency test with double drum size. It does not make sound. The wall design is bad.


## V2_square

Reduce size for simple design, also for potentially frequency shift. 3.9 kHz.

## V3_enclosed

Expand the output tube a little. It does not make sound. 

### V3.1_largerOpening

Increase the opening of V3. Still no sound. Based on the noise, the opening has to be bigger.
